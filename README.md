# Face Mask Detection using YOLOv8

This project demonstrates a custom face mask detection system built using YOLOv8.
The model detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not in images.

## Project Overview
- Task: Object Detection
- Classes: Mask, No Mask
- Model: YOLOv8 (custom trained)
- Platform: Google Colab
- Language: Python

## Workflow
1. Annotated face mask images
2. Trained a custom YOLOv8 model
3. Tested the model on random unseen images
4. Saved inference outputs as proof of work

## Sample Results
The images in the `outputs/` folder show detection results with bounding boxes
and class labels (mask / no_mask).

## Tools & Technologies
- YOLOv8
- Ultralytics
- Google Colab
- Computer Vision

## Note
This repository contains only inference results and configuration files.
The dataset is not included.
